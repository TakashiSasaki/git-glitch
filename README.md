Glitch.com seems to be ending its service in July 2025, so I downloaded the code locally.
All projects on Glitch were incorporated into a single repository as subdirectories using `git subtree`.
Since credentials like API keys were mixed in during work on Glitch, I replaced the secret strings with placeholders using `git filter-repo`.
